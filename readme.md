### What this is:

This is a simple tool whacked together to help with colaborative efforts early on in API design, and a quick way to get documentation up to speed.

Visually similiar to Swagger UI which couldn't be used with the stack I was working on, so hence created this. 

### What it does:

This is a basic CRUD form which stores end point deifnitions into a SQLite database. On each database it generates a JSON a file which which it writes to the system sytem for a second page to render.

The second page processes the JSON file to create ad hoc documentation to help team members and yourself develop an API and understand where everything is at.
